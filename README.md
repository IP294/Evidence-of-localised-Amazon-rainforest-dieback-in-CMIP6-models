# Evidence-of-localised-Amazon-rainforest-dieback-in-CMIP6-models
## Project Description
The project aimed to design an algorithm which would detect abrupt shifts in CMIP6 data and use this to observe potential tipping points in vegetation carbon in the Amazon rainforest within different CMIP6 models. Further analysis looked into a potential indicator of risk for grid points in the Amazon which were detectd as having an abrupt shift
The scripts in this repository take cveg and tas data from CMIP6 models
